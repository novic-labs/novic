                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                        on the

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;

                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:
        - name: msg.data.type_url
          description: >-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
            serialized

            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical

            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that
            they

            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
            the

            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
            type

            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

            type.googleapis.com.


            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

            used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                            least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                            path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                            in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                            beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        must represent

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

                        might be

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

      parameters:

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;

                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                            least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                            path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                            in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                       if err != nil {
                         ...
                       }
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".



                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);

                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                        any.Unpack(foo)

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default

                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      description: >-
                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.
                    value:
                      type: string

                        Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".



                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      description: >-
                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                      type: string

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                          least

                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                          in a canonical form

                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                          all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                          URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                          follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                          [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                          based on the

                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                          the official

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {

                      representation, that representation will be embedded

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as

                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.
                    value:
                      type: string

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                      description: >-
                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.
                    value:
                      type: string
                      format: byte

                        Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        message along with a

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message
                        [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.
                  value:
                    type: string

                    description: >-
                      Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above
                      specified type.

                  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
                  along with a

                  URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                       if err != nil {
                         ...
                       }
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;

                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      description: >-
                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                      type: string

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message
                        [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          least

                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                          must represent

                          in a canonical form

                          all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                          URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                          follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                          [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                          based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                          the official

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                          beginning with

                          type.googleapis.com.


                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                          scheme) might be

                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                      values in the form

                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                      the Any type.


                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any;
                          any.PackFrom(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                            ...
                          }

                      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                          }

                       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          foo = Foo(...)
                          any = Any()
                          any.Pack(foo)
                          ...
                          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                            any.Unpack(foo)
                            ...

                       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                           if err != nil {
                             ...
                           }
                           ...
                           foo := &pb.Foo{}
                           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                             ...
                           }

                      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                      default use

                      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                      the unpack

                      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                      last '/'

                      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                      yield type

                      name "y.z".



                      JSON

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                            "firstName": <string>,
                            "lastName": <string>
                          }

                      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                      custom JSON

                      representation, that representation will be embedded
                      adding a field

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                      `@type`

                      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                           ...
                         }

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          of the serialized

                          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                          least

                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                          must represent

                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                          in a canonical form

                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                          all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                          URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                          follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                          [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                          based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                          the official

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                          beginning with

                          type.googleapis.com.


                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                          scheme) might be

                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer

                      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                      values in the form

                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                      the Any type.


                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any;
                          any.PackFrom(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                            ...
                          }

                      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                          }

                       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          foo = Foo(...)
                          any = Any()
                          any.Pack(foo)
                          ...
                          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                            any.Unpack(foo)
                            ...

                       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                           if err != nil {
                             ...
                           }
                           ...
                           foo := &pb.Foo{}
                           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                             ...
                           }

                      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                      default use

                      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                      the unpack

                      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                      last '/'

                      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                      yield type

                      name "y.z".



                      JSON

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                            "firstName": <string>,
                            "lastName": <string>
                          }

                      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                      custom JSON

                      representation, that representation will be embedded
                      adding a field

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                      `@type`

                      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                            "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.
                    value:
                      type: string

                      description: >-
                        Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above
                        specified type.
                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                                In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                                binary all types that they

                                expect it to use in the context of Any. However,
                                for URLs which use the

                                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                                optionally set up a type

                                server that maps type URLs to message
                                definitions as follows:


                                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                                [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup
                                results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                  breaking changes.)

                                Note: this functionality is not currently

                            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol
                            buffer message along with a

                            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                            values in the form

                            of utility functions or additional generated methods
                            of the Any type.


                            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                                Foo foo = ...;
                                Any any;
                                any.PackFrom(foo);
                                ...
                                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                                  ...
                                }

                            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                                Foo foo = ...;
                                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                                ...
                                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                                }

                             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                                foo = Foo(...)
                                any = Any()
                                any.Pack(foo)
                                ...
                                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                  any.Unpack(foo)
                                  ...

                             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                                 if err != nil {
                                   ...
                                 }
                                 ...
                                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                                   ...
                                 }

                            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will
                            by default use

                            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL
                            and the unpack

                            methods only use the fully qualified type name after
                            the last '/'

                            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z"
                            will yield type

                            name "y.z".



                            JSON

                            ====

                            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                            regular

                            representation of the deserialized, embedded
                            message, with an

                            additional field `@type` which contains the type
                            URL. Example:

                                package google.profile;
                                message Person {
                                  string first_name = 1;
                                  string last_name = 2;
                                }

                                {
                                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                  "firstName": <string>,
                                  "lastName": <string>
                                }

                            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                            custom JSON

                            representation, that representation will be embedded
                            adding a field

                            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to
                            the `@type`

                            field. Example (for message
                            [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                                {

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.

                        on the

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                            path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                            in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                            beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message
                        [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any

                      JSON

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                            "firstName": <string>,
                            "lastName": <string>
                          }

                      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                      custom JSON

                      representation, that representation will be embedded
                      adding a field

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                      `@type`

                      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the

                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
              represent

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
              canonical form

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"

          A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
          serialized

          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

          the fully qualified name of the type (as in

          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical
          form

          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that
          they

          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
          the

          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
            value in binary format, or produce an error.
          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
            breaking changes.)

          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

          type.googleapis.com.


          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

          used with implementation specific semantics.

      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any;
          any.PackFrom(foo);
          ...
          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
            ...
          }

      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
          ...
          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
          }

       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

          foo = Foo(...)
          any = Any()
          any.Pack(foo)
          ...
          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
            any.Unpack(foo)
            ...

       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
           if err != nil {
             ...
           }
           ...
           foo := &pb.Foo{}
           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
             ...
           }

      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

      name "y.z".



      JSON

      ====

      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

          package google.profile;
          message Person {
            string first_name = 1;
            string last_name = 2;
          }

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
            "firstName": <string>,
            "lastName": <string>
          }

      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

      representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
            "value": "1.212s"
          }

                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                 if err != nil {
                   ...
                 }
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                  "value": "1.212s"

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
              }

              serialized

              protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
              represent

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
              canonical form

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                    types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                    which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                    official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                      "value": "1.212s"

            description: >-
              A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
              serialized

              protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
              represent

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
              canonical form

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".

                  the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                  canonical form

                  (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                  types that they

                  expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

              Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
              form

              of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
              type.


              Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any;
                  any.PackFrom(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                    ...
                  }

              Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                    foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                  }

               Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                  foo = Foo(...)
                  any = Any()
                  any.Pack(foo)
                  ...
                  if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                    any.Unpack(foo)
                    ...

               Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                   foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                   any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                   if err != nil {
                     ...
                   }
                   ...
                   foo := &pb.Foo{}
                   if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
              unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
              field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                    "value": "1.212s"

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                  the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                  types that they

                  expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

                   if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
              unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
              field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                    "value": "1.212s"
                  }

              A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
              serialized

              protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
              represent

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
              canonical form

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

              }

              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
              }

                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)

              A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
              serialized

              protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
              represent

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
              canonical form

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
              }

                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on

                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

              `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
              along with a

              URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


              Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
              form

              of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
              type.


              Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any;
                  any.PackFrom(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                    ...
                  }

              Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                    foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                  }

               Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                  foo = Foo(...)
                  any = Any()
                  any.Pack(foo)
                  ...
                  if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                    any.Unpack(foo)
                    ...

               Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                   foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                   any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                   if err != nil {
                     ...
                   }
                   ...
                   foo := &pb.Foo{}
                   if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
              unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
              field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                      "value": "1.212s"

                    A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
                    serialized

                    protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                    represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                    canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                    types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                    which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                    official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message

                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                      "value": "1.212s"

                  the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                  `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a

                  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                  types that they

                  expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

              Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
              form

              of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
              type.


              Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any;
                  any.PackFrom(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                    ...
                  }

              Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                    foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                  }

               Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                  foo = Foo(...)
                  any = Any()
                  any.Pack(foo)
                  ...
                  if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                    any.Unpack(foo)
                    ...

               Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                   foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                   any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                   if err != nil {
                     ...
                   }
                   ...
                   foo := &pb.Foo{}
                   if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
              unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
              field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                    "value": "1.212s"

                    A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
                    serialized

                    protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                    represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                    canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                    types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                    which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                    official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                  the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                  `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a

                  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                  types that they

                  expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

              Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
              form

              of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
              type.


              Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any;
                  any.PackFrom(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                    ...
                  }

              Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                    foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                  }

               Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                  foo = Foo(...)
                  any = Any()
                  any.Pack(foo)
                  ...
                  if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                    any.Unpack(foo)
                    ...

               Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                   foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                   any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                   if err != nil {
                     ...
                   }
                   ...
                   foo := &pb.Foo{}
                   if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
              unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
              field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the

                    protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                    represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                    canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                    types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                    which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                    official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);

              Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"

When coins are delegated to\r\nthis validator, the validator is credited with a delegation whose number of\r\nbond shares is based on the amount of coins delegated divided by the current\r\nexchange rate. Voting power can be calculated as total bonded shares\r\nmultiplied by exchange rate."
